        <h2>3D Designer</h2>
        <p>
        I am assertive, outspoken and tend to lead and be determined to achieve my goals. My strength is
        that I firmly believe in myself. I believe in my thoughts, so I tend to share them with those around
        me. I am also a strategic mind. I can plan ahead to ensure that my plans are met. This includes
        resolving crises and tackling challenges that arise along the way. Thus my weakness is my low
        tolerance level. Especially when alternative ideas are given based on emotional considerations. a
        fast learner and full of passion. I can work with teams or individuals. It depends on the
        circumstances of the company.
